# Projects

Here are several links to projects (both solo and collaborative) I've worked on in the past six months. These range from data analysis/manipulation to web development to utilizing machine learning models.


### QB Prospect Model
This project features a multiple linear regression model which projects NFL efficiency of quarterback prospects, using scikit-learn. I analyze the results, comparing them to the overall NFL Draft market.

### HQ Finder - Presentation Video
My group and I utilized APIs to pull data from the US Census, the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, and Google Maps. We then created an tool that could take user inputs about a company, feed that data to an algorithm which identified the top cities to host the companies headquarters, along with a visualization. I speak a bit towards the beginning about our overall process, but summarize my main analysis at the 15:20 mark.

### Latest Fantasy Football Article
I analyze potential situations to bench your QB for a different position (and vice versa). Along with written analysis and a few tables, there is also an interactive plot which visualizes QB matchups and DFS value plays.
